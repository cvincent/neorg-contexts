# Neorg Contexts

Neorg Contexts is a neorg module that will display the headings you're currently inside at the top of the buffer.
This is really similar to [nvim-treesitter-context](https://github.com/romgrk/nvim-treesitter-context).
The reason why this is a separate repository is that this is specifically for neorg and would require a lot of changes in the code of nvim-treesitter-context.
